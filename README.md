## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Cynthia-M-M/Basic-python-Calculator.git](https://github.com/Cynthia-M-M/Basic-python-Calculator.git)
   Here is the **rest of the README** for your Basic Python Calculator.

I have fixed the `git clone` command (removed the brackets so it works in the terminal) and added the **Usage** and **Project Structure** sections.

## 💻 Usage Example

When you run the program, you will see a menu to select an operation. Here is an example interaction:

```text
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

```
